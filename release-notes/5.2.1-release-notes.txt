- Improved the reliability of the SDK. In the event of an error from the network server, the SDK now automatically re-establishes the websocket connection to Amazon GameLift.
- Improved websocket reconnections to better maintain the existing connection when establishing the next connection.
- Fixed a bug with InitSDKFromEnvironment that could prevent container fleet validation.
- Updated the default logger to write to log files denoted by process ID.
- Added default behavior to onProcessTerminate to call ProcessEnding and Destroy.
- Improved client-side input validation for all websocket APIs.
